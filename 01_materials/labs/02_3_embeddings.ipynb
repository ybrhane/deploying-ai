    "# Representing Text\n",
    "\n",
    "We can represent text in many ways: character strings are a standard representation, but we can also create numerical representations of text. In this notebook we will discuss embeddings.\n",

    "## Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Features to any (machine learning) model can be continuous or categorical.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We use continuous features to represent numerical values: income, number of times the user clicked on a link, prices, etc.\n",
    "- Categorical features represent an instance of a class or category. They have a finite number of possible values: job title, genre of a movie, breed of a dog, etc.\n",

    "## Embeddings\n",

    "An **embedding** is a trained numerical representation of a categorical feature:\n",
    "\n",
