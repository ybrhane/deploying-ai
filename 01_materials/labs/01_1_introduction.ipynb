    "\n",
    "An Application Programming Interface or API is a mechanisms that enables two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. ([AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/api/))\n",
    "\n",
    "+ An *application* is any software with a distinct function. \n",
    "+ An *interface* can be seen as a contract between two applications that specifies how they will communicate with each other.\n",

    "## Types of APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four ways API can work:\n",
    "\n",
    "### SOAP APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Simple Object Access Protocol. \n",
    "+ Client and server exchange using XML. \n",
    "+ Popular in the past, but less flexible than more modern alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### RPC APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Remote Procedural Calls.\n",
    "+ Client completes a function (or procedure) on the server. \n",
    "+ The server sends the output back to the client.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Websocket APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Uses JSON objects to pass data.\n",
    "+ Supports two-way communication between client app and server.\n",
    "+ Server can send callback messages to connected clients, making it more efficient than REST API.\n",
    "\n",
    "### REST APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Representational State Transfer.\n",
    "+ Most popular and flexible APIs found today.\n",
    "+ Client sends request to the server as data.\n",
    "+ Server uses this client input to start internal functions and returns output data back to the client.\n",
    "+ Defines a set of functions like GET, PUT, DELETE, etc. that clients can use to access server data.\n",
    "+ Clients and servers exchange data using HTTP.\n",
    "+ REST APIs are stateless: servers do not save client data between requests. "
