    " LM Studio is a powerful platform designed for working with large language models (LLMs) on your local machine. It provides an intuitive interface for downloading, managing, and running a wide variety of open-source LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A few characteristics of LM Studio are:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ With LM Studio, users can experiment with different models, customize their settings, and interact with them in real time.\n",
    "+ The platform supports both CPU and GPU acceleration, making it accessible for a range of hardware configurations.\n",
    "+ LM Studio is ideal for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who want to explore the capabilities of LLMs without relying on cloud-based solutions.\n",

    "You can download and install LMStudio from [lmstudio.ai](https://lmstudio.ai/).\n",

    "\n",
    "An important characteristic in LM Studio is its support for OpenAI's API:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ LM Studio accepts requests on several OpenAI endpoints and returns OpenAI-like response objects ([lmstudio.ai](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering#message-roles-and-instruction-following)).\n",
    "+ This means that we can reuse our code by pointing the local API using the `base_url` parameter."
